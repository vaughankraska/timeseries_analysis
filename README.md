# Time Series Analysis Project 2024
## Description 
- Forecasting Water levels on the Gallatin River using Transfer Functions
- Water data came from:
https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/dv?cb_00060=on&format=rdb&site_no=06043500&legacy=&period=&begin_date=1989-08-01&end_date=2024-05-05
- Weather data came from:
https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/daily-summaries?pageNum=1&startDate=1989-08-01T23:59:59&endDate=2024-05-04T00:00:00&bbox=45.864,-111.415,45.195,-110.932

## What is where
/plots contains all the images used in the report plus some extras
/data has all the raw data and the rds files made from the raw data
final_document.rmd is the file used to generate all the other forms of the report
All other r scripts were me trying to make transfer functions and ARIMA based models work for forecasting the daily discharge on the gallatin river.

### Apologies to readers or future self, twas just trying to make the models work and it came at the cost of code and report quality
